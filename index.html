I am Seyed Hamed Vahedi.<br />
I was born on Feb 1981 in Rasht, Iran and I lived in the same city until 1999.<br />
I wrote the "Hello! World" program in 1994 with Turbo Pascal. Then I learned FoxPro and Delphi by studying the books. I extended Delphi language learning after entering university.<br />
I was recruited as a system programmer in 2003. My task was to support PCs and software. Of course, I was developing several applications via Delphi. I have focused on ASP.Net programming since 2005. Of course, I continued to produce applications using Delphi and C#. I work with web development teams as analyst and programmer since 2007.<br />
I have experienced advising on IT issues and teaching programming language to college students.<br /><br />
I share personal and technical experiences and daily writing on this site.<br /><br />
Wishing you all the great things in life.<br /><br />
